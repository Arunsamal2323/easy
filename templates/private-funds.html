                    What is Private Funding

                <h6 class="col-md-10" >
                    A private funding, also known as a private loan or private mortgage, is a loan agreement between two individuals or entities, where one party (the lender) provides funds to another party (the borrower) in exchange for a mortgage on a property. Private mortgages are an alternative to traditional bank mortgages and are typically facilitated by private investors, individuals, or private lending institutions.

                    Private funding often come into play when borrowers have difficulty qualifying for traditional bank financing due to factors such as poor credit history, unconventional income sources, or unique property situations.

                    Private money can offer more flexibility with loan terms, repayment schedules, and eligibility criteria compared to traditional mortgages.
